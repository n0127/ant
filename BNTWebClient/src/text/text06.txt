\t\t\t\tThe mnemonic is another manifestation of the plaintext private key, first proposed by the BIP39 proposal, to help users remember complex private keys (64-bit hashes). Mnemonics are generally composed of 12, 15, 18, and 21 words. These words are taken from a fixed vocabulary. The order of generation is also based on a certain algorithm, so the user does not have to worry about inputting 12 words at random. address. Although both mnemonics and Keystore can be used as another form of private key, unlike Keystore, the mnemonic is an unencrypted private key, without any security, anyone gets your help. Remembering words, you can take away your assets without any effort. Therefore, after the user backs up the mnemonic, be sure to pay attention to three points: 1. Use physical media backup as much as possible, such as using a pen to copy on paper, etc., as far as possible, do not take screenshots or take photos and put them on networked devices. Preventing hackers from stealing 2. Verifying that the backup mnemonics are correct multiple times. Once you have mistyped one or two words, it will bring great difficulties to the subsequent recovery of the correct mnemonic; 3. The backup mnemonic Keep the words in good condition and do the anti-theft and anti-lost measures.\n\n\n

PS: The user can use the backup mnemonic, re-import ANT Token, generate a new Keystore with the new password, and modify the wallet password in this way.\n
